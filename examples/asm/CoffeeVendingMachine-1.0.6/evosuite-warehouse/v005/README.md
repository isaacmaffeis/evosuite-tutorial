# V005
Fixed the problems of the autogenerated version, I obtained correlation between this class
and the target class. 

Evosuite generates 3 scenario correctly, we can try to add a final state to improve the consistency.

## Problems

## How to
```shell
mvn compile
```
```shell
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DincludeScope=runtime
```
```shell
java -jar evosuite-1.0.6.jar -setup target/classes target/dependency/commons-collections-3.2.2.jar
```
```shell
java -jar .\evosuite-1.0.6.jar -class org.evoservice.coffeeVendingMachineNC.coffeeVendingMachineNC_ASM -criterion LINE:BRANCH -Dminimize=true -Dassertion_strategy=all
```
