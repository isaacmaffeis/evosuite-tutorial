# V002

Fixed the parenthesis bug and autogenerated the ASM class.

It's a particular case because we don't have the monitored functions but only controlled functions.
Hence the step function is without arguments and we don't need to set any variable.

## Problems

- Evosuite generate only 1 scenario with 1 step even though the coverage is 100% 

## How to
```shell
mvn compile
```
```shell
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DincludeScope=runtime
```
```shell
java -jar ../../../resources/evosuite-1.0.6.jar -setup target/classes target/dependency/commons-collections-3.2.2.jar
```
```shell
java -jar ../../../resources/evosuite-1.0.6.jar -class org.evoservice.advancedClock.AdvancedClock_ASM -criterion LINE:BRANCH -Dminimize=true -Dassertion_strategy=all
```
