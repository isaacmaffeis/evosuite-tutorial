# V004
by adding the final state condition we can generate the same scenario generated by EvoMBT-
```
// final state condition
public boolean isFinalState(){
    return
            this.stato >=18 &&
                    this.get_status() ==TrafficLightv2.States.RED;
}
```
## Problems

## How to
```shell
mvn compile
```
```shell
mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DincludeScope=runtime
```
```shell
java -jar ../../../resources/evosuite-1.0.6.jar -setup target/classes target/dependency/commons-collections-3.2.2.jar
```
```shell
java -jar ../../../resources/evosuite-1.0.6.jar -class org.evoservice.trafficLight.TrafficLightv2_ASM -criterion LINE:BRANCH -Dminimize=true -Dassertion_strategy=all
```
