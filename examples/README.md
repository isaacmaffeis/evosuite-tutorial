# Examples Directory
The examples directory contains several project examples designed to demonstrate the capabilities and evolution of EvoSuite over different versions. 
Specifically, I have included the same example project tested using three different versions of EvoSuite: 1.0.6, 1.1.0, and 1.2.0.

## Purpose
The purpose of these examples is to:

- Compare Stability: Evaluate the stability of each EvoSuite version by running the same tests across the three versions.
- Identify Issues: Identify and document any issues or discrepancies that arise with each version.

## Contents
Within the examples directory, you will find subdirectories named after each EvoSuite version (e.g., evosuite-1.0.6, evosuite-1.1.0, evosuite-1.2.0). 
Each of these subdirectories contains:

- The example project source code.
- Configuration files and scripts used for running EvoSuite.
- Generated test cases and reports.

## Usage
To run the example project with a specific version of EvoSuite:

- Navigate to the corresponding subdirectory.
- Follow the instructions provided in the README.md file within each subdirectory to set up and execute the tests.

## Goals
By comparing the results across these versions, users can:

- Determine which version might be the most stable for their specific use cases.
- Gain insights into any recurring or new issues introduced in different versions.
