## Introduction

EvoSuite is a tool that automatically generates unit tests for Java software. It uses evolutionary algorithms to generate test cases that achieve high code coverage. This repository provides a step-by-step guide through various aspects of using EvoSuite.

## Tutorial Part 1: Getting Started

In this part, you will learn how to install EvoSuite and generate your first set of test cases.

## Tutorial Part 2: Advanced Usage

This section covers more advanced features of EvoSuite, including assertions and search-based testing techniques.

- [Tutorial Part 2: Advanced Usage](https://www.evosuite.org/documentation/tutorial-part-2/)

## Tutorial Part 3: Integrating with Build Tools

Learn how to integrate EvoSuite with build tools like Maven and Gradle to streamline the test generation process in your development workflow.

## Tutorial Part 4: Customizing EvoSuite

This part explains how to customize EvoSuite's behavior to suit your specific testing needs and improve the efficiency of the generated test cases.

## Examples

The examples directory contains several project examples designed to demonstrate the capabilities and evolution of EvoSuite over different versions. Specifically, I have included the same example project tested using three different versions of EvoSuite: 1.0.6, 1.1.0, and 1.2.0.
